	Waterfall Model
o	Requirements:
	Each user must have a WIT ID
	Each user must either be a student, instructor, or admin
	Goal is for the database to work for 100+ users
	Must contain course information
	Must be able to view schedule and access the 
	Must have a GUI
o	System Design
	An interactive interface to display the necessary functions the user needs
	Students can view their schedules and register, etc…
	Instructors can see available courses and so on…
	Admin has access to see everything
o	Implementation
	Using OOP classes to create the user database
	Code(s) written in C++, Python, and Java
	Inherited classes
	Tested the functions by calling them in Driver code
	Tested the attributes by calling the first and last name, and ID
o	Integration & Testing
1.	Test the code by creating instances in the Driver file
2.	Calling the functions to see which one works and which ones don’t
3.	Transforming the code into a GUI with a user-friendly interface rather than viewing from the terminal
4.	Adding a database or importing from a list of 100 students, 10 instructors, and one admin to find bugs
5.	Reiterating through steps 1-5 to find more bus and debug
o	Operation and Maintenance
	Put code under stress test to see where the bugs are
	Try to organize code using OOP approaches so that we can practice encapsulation since this is a database with sensitive information
•	Try to make methods private and inaccessible
	Update small and minor things such as variables, loops, conditional statements
